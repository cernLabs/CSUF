The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is interested in contracting you to analyze
some data from their air to air missile defense program.
When a hostile flying object enters protected airspace, DARPA launches a missile to intercept and
destroy that hostile object. Objectively, the missile needs to be able to track the distance between itself
and the hostile object accurately.
For testing the interceptors, drones were used to simulate hostile flying objects. Drone gps provide very
accurate information on the location of the drones.
The data provided to you includes two variables. First is the actual distance (km) between the missile
and the test drone. This is the predictor or explanatory variable. Second is the error (m) in the
estimated position of the drone by the missile and the true position of the drone. It should make sense
that the farther apart the drone and the missile are, the larger the error will be on average.
Your contacts at DARPA have asked that you build a model that can estimate the average error in drone
position given a fixed distance between the drone and missile. Your model will then be used to adjust
the perceived position of the drone.
Specifically, they want to know what you think the average error will be at 0.1, 1 and 10 km respectively.
Please provide a short (but thorough) report with your findings.
(This is a way over-simplified version of a dataset I actually worked on for DARPA way back in the
day...Bonus points if anyone can guess why we see the oscillating behavior in the response variable)
