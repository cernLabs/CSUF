bootstrap in regression

-> fit original model (kernel regression code). store original residuals

-> get BS_x from X
+ sample with replacement 'n' observations from X

-> get BS-yhat from pluggin in BS_x to original model
-> BS_y =  BS_yhat + (original residuals) <- how do I get these?

-> new model (kern regression) using BS_x, BS_y

-> plug x_1 = 10 into new model; store result
-> repeat 10000 times
-> find alpha/2, -alpha/2 cutoff

Probably should make some residual diagnostic plots...
Always check assumptions on the exam . . .
