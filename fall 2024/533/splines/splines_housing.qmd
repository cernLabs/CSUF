## Introduction

\<rewrite this\>

Prediction of the Median House value and what factors affect this.

## Data Exploration

```{r}
# import data
df <- read.csv("housing.csv", header = T)
# import libraries
library(splines)
library(GGally)
```

```{r}
# need to correlation of these predictors
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
plot(df$median_house_value,df$housing_median_age)
plot(df$median_house_value,df$population)
ggcorr(df)
```

From here we see that population and housing_median_age are not well correlated.

```{r}
# linear model 
prim_lm <- lm(df$median_house_value ~ df$population + df$housing_median_age)

```

```{r}
# spline model
```
